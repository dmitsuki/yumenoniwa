This blog is nothing special. It’s just a place for me to write my thoughts about life, art and programming. I don’t particuarly expect anybody to read it, but having a sort of “digital dairy” is a nice thing to have. It also acts as a nice digital footprint to look back on to see what I was doing or thinking about at certain times. Now that I’m in my 30’s, when I think about my 20’s I have a general idea of everything that happened, but very limited documented expereinces. I didn’t journal, I don’t take many pictures of anything, and the only thing I have to go by is my memory that get’s refreshed whenever I see work from certain years. Having cohesive thoughts placed together to look back on will be nice.">

<p>This blog is nothing special. It&rsquo;s just a place for me to write my thoughts about life, art and programming. I don&rsquo;t particuarly expect anybody to read it, but having a sort of &ldquo;digital dairy&rdquo; is a nice thing to have. It also acts as a nice digital footprint to look back on to see what I was doing or thinking about at certain times. Now that I&rsquo;m in my 30&rsquo;s, when I think about my 20&rsquo;s I have a general idea of everything that happened, but
very limited documented expereinces. I didn&rsquo;t journal, I don&rsquo;t take many pictures of anything, and the only thing I have to go by is my memory that get&rsquo;s refreshed whenever I see work from certain years. Having cohesive thoughts placed together to look back on will be nice.</p>
<h3 id="why-yume-no-niwa">Why Yume no Niwa</h3>
<p>Yume no Niwa means &ldquo;Garden of Dreams.&rdquo; For the most part, I just think it sounds cool. And at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s a good a reason as any to do something, so I hope you enjoy future post from the Garden of Dreams.</p>
