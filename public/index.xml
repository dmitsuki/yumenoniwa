      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;late-to-the-trend&#34;&gt;Late to the trend&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2025 seems like a weird time to start a blog, but with the growing amount of automatically generated content, I figured why not add a little bit of humanity to the world by starting a vintage, hand written blog?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog is nothing special. It&amp;rsquo;s just a place for me to write my thoughts about life, art and programming. I don&amp;rsquo;t particuarly expect anybody to read it, but having a sort of &amp;ldquo;digital dairy&amp;rdquo; is a nice thing to have. It also acts as a nice digital footprint to look back on to see what I was doing or thinking about at certain times. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m in my 30&amp;rsquo;s, when I think about my 20&amp;rsquo;s I have a general idea of everything that happened, but&#xA;very limited documented expereinces. I didn&amp;rsquo;t journal, I don&amp;rsquo;t take many pictures of anything, and the only thing I have to go by is my memory that get&amp;rsquo;s refreshed whenever I see work from certain years. Having cohesive thoughts placed together to look back on will be nice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
